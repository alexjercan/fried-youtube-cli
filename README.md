# Fried YouTube

Tired of having to watch YouTube videos without being able to stimulate your
dopamine receptors enough? Then you must check out **Fried YouTube**. This new
piece of technology let's you merge your favorite YouTube video with a video of
Minecraft parkour to fix your attention span.

TLDR: Transform YouTube in TikTok from the CLI.

### QuickStart

Run the script with the url that you want to watch. This will create a mp4 file
that you can watch.

```

If you run it for the first time it will also have to download the minecraft
video, but it is what it is.

A: I know, currently it does not support streaming so you have to wait for the
entire video to generate first. Trust me, the dopamine will be worth it.

Q: What to do while I wait for the video to render?
A: Watch some TikTok.
